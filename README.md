<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This may seem like your average and totally legit Bobux generator site, but it ends up crashing your browser.

Here's why:
* You go here thinking you are gonna get some of them free Bobux from Rick Astley himself.
* You press "Continue to Bobux generator" and it redirects you to the Bobux generator.
* But wait, your browser freezes!
* It wasnt a Bobux generator at all! It was a mere act of tomfoolery!
* Then your wife leaves you because you fell for this obvious prank.
* Your now sad and alone with a frozen browser.

## Why Would You Waste Your Time Making This?
